# Task 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This notebook applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to a manually uploaded breast cancer dataset.

# What I did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Visualized the decision boundary using 2 features
- Evaluated the model using cross-validation

# Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)

## Accuracy
Best model accuracy from cross-validation: **XX.XX%**
